    <h1>My favorite hobby <br>Sports</h1>
    <div></div>
    <p> Sports are very good for health. I like sports because they are very fun. My father wakes me up at 6 in the morning and we go to a park . i play with my friends everyday. sports also keep you fit and stop you from getting fat. sports can  have many advantages like burning calories or losing weight or even building a storng body ;) They can also increase our height there are many sports like football,soccer,badminton,tennis i personally like to play badminton and football and french cricket etc.</p>
